# ELF Hobbit: A Feed Forward Neural Network for Malware Detection


ELF Hobbit is Feed Forward Neural Network designed to identify and flag malicious ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files in Linux and Unix systems. Trained on an extensive dataset of both malicious and benign files, ELF Hobbit offers unparalleled accuracy and efficiency in detecting potential security threats. The dataset can be found here https://github.com/nimrodpar/Labeled-Elfs

Key Features:
Robust Detection: Capable of identifying a wide array of malware families, including notorious threats like Mirai, BASHLITE-1.0, BASHLITE-lizkebab, and Lightaidra-1.0.

Cross-Architecture Compatibility: Designed with versatility in mind, ELF Hobbit supports both ARM and x86/x64 architectures, ensuring broad applicability across different hardware platforms.

Elf Hobbit's intelligence is derived from an extensive collection of ELF binaries, capturing a wide spectrum of malware characteristics. Among the most significant threats it can detect are:

Mirai Botnet: A powerful DDoS malware that has affected IoT devices worldwide. Learn more about Mirai
BASHLITE: Also known as Gafgyt, this malware targets IoT devices to form botnets for large-scale DDoS attacks. Explore BASHLITE
Lightaidra: A Trojan that targets routers and IoT devices, creating armies of infected devices. Details on Lightaidra
