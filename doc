## Getting Started

### Import the Required Libraries

First, ensure you have imported all of the required libraries for your project by adding the following Python code to your script or interactive session:

```python
import os
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ReduceLROnPlateau
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

After you have imported the necessary libraries, run the ELF Hobbit application by executing the following command in your terminal:

python elf-hobbit.py
